**NOTE: From Tuesday 2nd Feburary onwards Azure would not let us update the website from the github. We tried many fixes over a few days and nothing seems to be fixing the issue and we have had to stop our sprint work for a few days to try and solve this. We have emaile Mike Crabb about this issue.
