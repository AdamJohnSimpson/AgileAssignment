# Sprint Retrospective

# Retrospective Report (from Sprint 1)
Our first action was to increase the amount of work we placed in our sprint backlog in the sprint planning phase. We placed the remaining user stories in the sprint backlog and adjusted the time given in the initial planning poker to make our estimation more realistic. However, we predicted our velocity would increase this sprint but that was not the case as last week’s planning poker time was overestimated and we encountered several major problems with Azure this sprint.

We continued to use Discord to work together as a team, we had multiple voice channels to act as different rooms where we could work individually or in small groups and we can easily drop in on each other to ask questions. We also have different text channels for sharing images/screenshots, along with other text channels for break purposes. (see discordScreenshot in this folder)

We changed the way we did our pull requests by spending more time on them and putting proper comments in so it is clear what each pull request is about. We wanted to start implementing larger pull requests that would be more feature-based then in the previous sprint but we decided to stick with how we were doing it. This is because to test our website, code needs to be on the master branch so it wasn’t as practical to do larger pull requests.

We continued to have code reviews by using atom teletype and having other people review and confirm pull requests. This allowed us to spot/resolve the smaller errors in code such as syntax errors in php, or logic errors in sql statements.
