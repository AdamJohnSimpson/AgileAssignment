# Sprint Retrospective

# Retrospective Report (from Sprint 1)
Our first action was to increase the amount of work we placed in our sprint backlog in the sprint planning phase. We placed the remaining user stories in the sprint backlog and adjusted the time given in the initial planning poker to make our estimation more realistic. However, we predicted our velocity would increase this sprint but that was not the case as last week’s planning poker time was overestimated and we encountered several major problems with Azure this sprint.

We continued to use Discord to work together as a team, we had multiple voice channels to act as different rooms where we could work individually or in small groups and we can easily drop in on each other to ask questions. We also have different text channels for sharing images/screenshots, along with other text channels for break purposes. (see discordScreenshot in this folder)

We changed the way we did our pull requests by spending more time on them and putting proper comments in so it is clear what each pull request is about. We wanted to start implementing larger pull requests that would be more feature-based then in the previous sprint but we decided to stick with how we were doing it. This is because to test our website, code needs to be on the master branch so it wasn’t as practical to do larger pull requests.

We continued to have code reviews by using atom teletype and having other people review and confirm pull requests. This allowed us to spot/resolve the smaller errors in code such as syntax errors in php, or logic errors in sql statements.

# Retrospective Sprint 2
We successfully worked in line with the points of improvement we laid out in week 1’s retrospective meeting. This included improving the clarity of our github pull requests and adjusting our velocity to a more appropriate value since we now have evidence of our team’s weekly capabilities. We’ve found that even just these small changes have allowed us to continue working at a very effective rate as a team and we hope to continue improving on these aspects as we go.

We still believe that it is through our strong teamwork and cooperation that we have managed to progress through this project in such a productive and speedy way. This was particularly shown when we encountered problems outside of our control as a result of Microsoft Azure and how instead of giving up we remained strong as a team and worked together to adapt and overcome this. We eventually managed to get this all sorted as we continued to try and try again together.
Even though we had such a drastic problem, we still have not experienced any issues in terms of our approach to teamwork. 

Our intentions for sprint 3 are to continue as we are already working, we haven’t noticed any particular points in our teamwork that need notable improvement.
