### Summary of Conversation:
**Previous Tasks**
- We conducted our sprint planning from 9:00am - 11:00am and started Sprint 2 at 11:00am

**Issues**
- The issue we were having is with our pull requests. Since we have to have things on master so we can test them, there are a lot of small pull requests instead of large feature based ones. We looked into solutions such as MAMP (https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/), however we just decided to stick with our current method for this sprint to save time, but in future we will use this instead.

**Today's Tasks**
- Adam Sh: continue trying to be able to export the questionnaire data as a .csv file, if completed will then work on visualising data in a bar graph
- Adam Si/Beth: adding the slight adjustments that came as a result of sprint 1 review (moving/adding buttons), work on creating multiple choice questions in a questionnaire
- Craig: working on being able to display usability scale questions
- Euan: adding a checkbox to indicate whether or not the participent has filled out an ethics form
- Holly: create the show individual results page and get it to be able to show individual repsonses
- Scott: working on being able to add timestamps to videos

## Day [3] - Scrum Meeting summary
The Scrum Master for this meeting was **Holly Groves**

### Members Present:
Adam Shepherd, Adam Simpson, Beth Ogilvy, Craig Ritchie, Euan Taylor, Holly Groves and Scott Fulton

### Members Not Present:

### Apologies:

### Summary of Conversation:
**Yesterday's Tasks**
- Adam Sh: started work on adding bar graphs to visualise all responses for a questionnaire (including usability scale)
- Adam Si/Beth: finished being able to do usability scale question (pair programming video)
- Craig: added ability to let principle researchers add/remove coresearchers from their experiment
- Euan: can add transcript to the database, needs to be linked to videos
- Holly: started work on being able to display individal usability scale questions results and started trying to get playing in sync videos to work
- Scott: working on being able to add timestamps to videos and comments along with the time stamps

**Issues**
- We had a big issue yesterday that meant our website would stop updating, which occured around 3:00pm so no one could continue any work after this time. Yesterday we tried many solutions, such as redeploying, commenting out code, relinking the github to azure and deleting files. However we eventually realised before this meeting that somehow the build type on azure had switched so instead of carrying out the build in azure it was trying to do it on github, which wasn't working and hence not updating. We have hopefully solved this now.

**Today's Tasks**
- Adam Sh: continue trying to get bar graphs on the website to visualise data
- Adam Si/Beth/Scott: rearranging the way videos and timestamps/transcipts are stored and working on getting time stamps working
- Craig: working on letting coresearchers see the experiments the have been added to but not allow them to add/remove coreseachers
- Euan: working on adding transcripts to a database so it links to the videos
- Holly: continue working on syncing videos and getting usability responses to display no that has finished
