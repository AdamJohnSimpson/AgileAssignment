### Members Present:
Adam Shepherd, Adam Simpson, Beth Ogilvy, Craig Ritchie, Euan Taylor, Holly Groves and Scott Fulton

### Members Not Present:
n/a

### Apologies:
n/a

### Summary of Conversation:
**Previous Tasks**
- We conducted our sprint planning from 9:00am - 11:00am and started Sprint 2 at 11:00am

**Issues**
- The issue we were having is with our pull requests. Since we have to have things on master so we can test them, there are a lot of small pull requests instead of large feature based ones. We looked into solutions such as MAMP (https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/), however we just decided to stick with our current method for this sprint to save time, but in future we will use this instead.

**Today's Tasks**
- Adam Sh: continue trying to be able to export the questionnaire data as a .csv file, if completed will then work on visualising data in a bar graph
- Adam Si/Beth: adding the slight adjustments that came as a result of sprint 1 review (moving/adding buttons), work on creating multiple choice questions in a questionnaire
- Craig: working on being able to display usability scale questions
- Euan: adding a checkbox to indicate whether or not the participent has filled out an ethics form
- Holly: create the show individual results page and get it to be able to show individual repsonses
- Scott: working on being able to add timestamps to videos
