Today's tasks
- Euan and Craig: continue to work on the login page and the database to store user logins in
- Adam Sh: continue to set up the database so the correct tables can be set up so the PHP can be finished

- Adam Si, Scott, Holly, Beth: split off into 2 pairs for pair programming to work on the "List Questionnaire" pages

Yesterday's Tasks
- Login page for researchers code (html) is done (Euan)
- A page that lists all users is done so that when you click on a user it will get the information about them (Craig), still needs work with the database
- Database created, website is hosted and there is now a place for files to be saved for the website. Files (videos) are not being stored on github, they are being stored on       azure (Adam Sh)
- The "Make a questionnaire" page has the html created (Holly, Adam Si, Scott)
- The "Make a questionnaire" page has CSS added along with university branding (Adam Si)
- The "Make a Questionnaire" page has some PHP written, just needs the proper database tables set up (Beth)
- .mp4 vidoes can be uploaded to the website by the user (Adam Sh)

Issues from Yesterday
 - We orginally intended to use github pages to host our website, however that does not support PHP so we switched to Microsfot Azure
 - We struggled slighlty to set up Microsoft Azure however it is all set up correctly now and our website is currently being hosted at https://agile-assignment-group-4.azurewebsites.net/ 
 - Adam Sh had a slight issue with the PHP for uploading videos, we initally thought it was to do with the file type however the file size in the code was not set large enough      to be able to store videos, this has been corrected now

- there was a problem with being able to play videos due to the permissions on Microsoft Azure where the videos are being stored. After asking for help and eventually finding a solution which was to do with the way it was configured, videos can be played
