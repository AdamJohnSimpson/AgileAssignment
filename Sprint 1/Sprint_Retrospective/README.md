# Sprint Retrospective
---
- We originally underestimated our velocity, and managed to get more work done than we originally planned, so for next sprint we can plan to do more work in the beginning.

- Our main strength is our team working, using Discord rooms we can all go into pairs/groups in different rooms allowing us to join others when someone needs help on what they are working. We are find this way of working effective as it makes solving problems easier as we are sharing our knowledge and expertise in certain areas with others

- When doing pull requests, put more logical comments. As we have to commit before we can test, there is a lot of small commits trying to find fixes for small errors in the code. The commits themselves are commented properly but when it comes to doing the pull request not all pulls are consistent

- We will continue to do code reviews, when another person other than the creator merges their code into master.
